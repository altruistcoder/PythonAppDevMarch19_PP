Assignment (Lecture-5)


1. Write a generator function to iterate over first `n` fibonacci numbers.

2. Consider a list of the form:
	```
	[
		(x1, y1, z1),
	 	(x2, y2, z2),
	 	(x3, y3, z3),
	 	.
	 	.
	 	.
	 	(xn, yn, zn)
	 ]
	```
	Transform it to following form:
	```
	[
		(x1, x2, x3, ...., xn),
		(y1, y2, y3, ...., yn),
		(z1, z2, z3, ...., zn)
	]
	```

3. Write a Python program to count the frequency of words in a file.

4. Write a program which takes a text file as input and does following operations sequentially over it:
	- Create a list of words present in file
	- Convert all words to uppercase (using map)
	- Remove the words from list which contain 'a' (using filter)
	- Generate a string by concatenating all the words in the final list (using reduce)

5. Write a Python program to print all the Sundays of a specified year.

6. Write a Python class to get all possible unique subsets from a set of distinct integers.
	```
	Input : [4, 5, 6]
	Output : [[], [6], [5], [5, 6], [4], [4, 6], [4, 5], [4, 5, 6]]
	```

7. Try to solve **all** the hackerrank questions given in previous assignments.
